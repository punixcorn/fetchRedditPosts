ASS (Assholes Sharing Stories), Asshole Amnesty Month.\n\nTell us about a time when you were the asshole. We can relax *some* sub rules a bit (a revenge story is probably fine, since you‚Äôre recalling, and not asking for judgment). But, other sub rules still apply (no violent encounters, for example)! Let us know about a time when you knew you were the asshole. Maybe you didn‚Äôt mean to be, but after the encounter, you realized you were TA. Or, maybe you knew what you were doing, and went through with it anyway! \n\nPersonally, I've always felt the more low-stakes the issue, the better. Those are always my favorite AITA stories, but feel free to share whatever you may have. And most important - have fun with it! \n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

Last week, my sister law gave birthday to a healthy baby girl, as you can probably guess, they named Scarlett. I was really upset at my brother as he knows that was my top name, I didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it I just left the room obviously upset, Scarlett isn‚Äôt a family name or anything and my brother has never mentioned liking the name, one time he said he wasn‚Äôt a fan. I asked him why he would name his daughter that and he told me to stop over reacting and get over it and that i don‚Äôt own the name. I get that It doesn‚Äôt belong to me but just because I am a teenager doesn‚Äôt mean\nthat I am not allowed to have plans for my future.\n\nEDIT: when i say walked out I didnt like storm out or anything i just excused myself. A lot of people are saying that its common for cousins to have to same name but not here and in my family. And. Scarlett isnt a common name here ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSome people are confused, im a girl.

We have just been on holiday and missed our flight home due to oversleeping. We woke up and I was panicking as I had work the next day so was looking at flights. I had originally found a cheaper option which would mean us getting a cheap coach to another airport meaning that we get the cheaper flight to a different city in our country, and that my partner would pick us up and drop us home. \n\nThey didn‚Äôt want to get the coach even though it would‚Äôve worked out cheaper for all of us, so I had to make a decision and found one seat on a direct flight home which would get me in earlier. This was okayed by two of them but one of my other friends said it was selfish. I booked the flight and then helped them find an alternative flight for the three of them. Splitting any of the costs wasn‚Äôt discussed or agreed at this point. \n\nI left for the airport and then got a message from one of them asking if I would be cool to split the costs of all the flights together. At first I wasn‚Äôt sure but had a think about it and decided it was fair as they got more expensive flights. My flight was delayed by 9 hours and they ultimately got home before me. They had to fly to a different city and get train tickets home for a 3 hour train. \n\nThe next day I sent over the calculations of what I would have to send each of them but they weren‚Äôt happy as I hadn‚Äôt included their train tickets, but they would‚Äôve had to buy transport home regardless of if we made our original flight (albeit the new train tickets they bought were more expensive). This wasn‚Äôt a cost agreed and now there is back and forth about what I should pay as they spent more on getting home. \n\nI didn‚Äôt choose the earlier flight due to cost, just to get home for my responsibilities as I had work the next day whilst they had an extra day off. Now I feel villainised for doing so, although they were okay with it at the time of me booking my flight. I feel like I‚Äôve been more than fair in splitting the flights but the train was a surprise cost put on me. Before the holiday I hosted them the night before and my partner gave us a lift to the airport which saved us about ¬£50-¬£60 in airport transfers and he also paid for the drop off cost. \n\nAm I the asshole for disagreeing with this? I struggle to set boundaries sometimes and feel a bit bullied into this. I feel like they have fallen out with me over this, which seems pointless as we have had a lovely holiday. Has anyone got any advice with this? I want to say no but I am struggling with advocating for myself here. ",

He kicks it against the side of the building, against the inside walls of his apartment, slams it into the ceiling (my floor), and throws it onto the roof. This isn't just loud; it shakes my entire apartment. I work a night shift, and this makes it impossible for me to sleep. \n\nBy chance, he kicked his soccer ball onto my balcony, and I just haven't given it back. It's been two days, and he has been knocking on my door continuously for those two days. He knocked (beat) on my door for two hours straight today, and at least once every hour after that. The thing is, I can sleep through someone knocking on my door, I can't sleep through my apartment shaking. I was finally able to sleep a full 8 hours today and I really don't want that to go away.

            "selftext": "I got married (22f) to my husband (24m) a few weeks ago. The wedding overall went great even though there were a few minor hiccups. We hired a professional photographer who stated in his contract that we couldn't hire another photographer besides him. If we wanted a second photographer, we had to hire one of his assistants or coworkers. This is pretty typical in the wedding industry.\n\nMy aunt surprised us at the wedding by doing photography as a gift to us. This was very surprising and she didn't tell anyone besides her husband. She's a real estate photographer, so she has a fancy camera and occasionally takes pictures of people. Our photographer was PISSED. He pulled me aside and asked what was going on and I had to explain the whole situation, which made me extremely stressed. While taking pictures, my aunt would pull people aside when they needed to be with the professional photographer for group photos. It turned into a chaotic mess, but we wanted to be kind and were SO stressed and had no time to tell her to stop.\n\nWe got the photos back from her last night. The photos of me were rough. They're taken from a low angle so I have a double chin, my mouth is open in 1/3 of the shots (talking, eating, etc). There's zoom ins of my face and my eyes are closed. They're pretty much all candid's. You can see how stressed out I am in my facial expressions, because behind the scenes the real photographer was shouting at us to hurry up.\n\nIn comparison, the photos of my friends taken by her were all staged by her and look gorgeous. People are smiling , posed, and beautiful. I began sobbing seeing them. I showed the photos to a few of my friends and they very kindly told me that they were unflattering pictures of me.\n\nMy family received the photos and plans on putting them up in their house because they're from my aunt. I asked them to wait because we will have professional photos soon, but they don't want to wait for those. I'm insecure about my appearance and I've been sent photos of me squinting or with my eyes closed with a double chin calling me beautiful and I just know that's not the case based on my non family member's reactions.\n\nMy husband said these features are normal in humans and that he didn't like his hair in the pictures and to just get used to it. I cried off and on when looking at them and told him it was different because he's smiling, his eyes are open in the photos. He got angry and said the point of a wedding is to celebrate our love and that the photos don't matter. He told me to just stop looking at them if it's going to make me cry and I just didn't say anything after that.  I wish he was more empathetic, but he thinks I'm being self centered and remained upset at me for crying for the rest of the night.\n\n  \nEdit: We had already started taking professional photos when she showed up and began grabbing people for pictures. We didn't fully realize what was going on until she began grabbing people away. We thought she was just taking photos of her own kids. After she began taking pictures of everyone and grabbing people, she told us it was our gift and the photographer asked what was up and we told him and he saw how upset we were so he didn't' leave. We had 30 minutes until the ceremony and we didn't want to start an argument with her when we were stressed enough.\n\n\n\nAITA",

She wanted people to know that she cared about them. \n\nAfter she had each of my daughters, she wrote them a letter. She wrote each within days after their births and wanted to give them away on their graduation days. She put them in the fire box in our basement to avoid losing or forgetting about them. She wrote the letters with the intention of giving them to our daughters herself 18 years later as a sort of time capsule type of thing. Both letters contained mostly words of wisdom and information about what was going on when they were born. \n\nMaeve graduated from high school today and I went to her room with the letter tonight. I let her cry on my shoulder as she read it and at first she seemed happy to have her something directly from her mother. However after she read it she turned to me looking surprisingly angry. She asked why I had waited so long to give it to her. She had so many rough moments and heartbreak in the last 8 years where all she wanted was her mother‚Äôs wisdom and I withheld the letter. \n\nI told her that I was just doing what her mother had said she wanted and Maeve shot back that her mother also hadn‚Äôt planned on being in the accident.

We have just been on holiday and missed our flight home due to oversleeping. We woke up and I was panicking as I had work the next day so was looking at flights. I had originally found a cheaper option which would mean us getting a cheap coach to another airport meaning that we get the cheaper flight to a different city in our country, and that my partner would pick us up and drop us home. \n\nThey didn‚Äôt want to get the coach even though it would‚Äôve worked out cheaper for all of us, so I had to make a decision and found one seat on a direct flight home which would get me in earlier. This was okayed by two of them but one of my other friends said it was selfish. I booked the flight and then helped them find an alternative flight for the three of them. Splitting any of the costs wasn‚Äôt discussed or agreed at this point. \n\nI left for the airport and then got a message from one of them asking if I would be cool to split the costs of all the flights together. At first I wasn‚Äôt sure but had a think about it and decided it was fair as they got more expensive flights. My flight was delayed by 9 hours and they ultimately got home before me. They had to fly to a different city and get train tickets home for a 3 hour train. \n\nThe next day I sent over the calculations of what I would have to send each of them but they weren‚Äôt happy as I hadn‚Äôt included their train tickets, but they would‚Äôve had to buy transport home regardless of if we made our original flight (albeit the new train tickets they bought were more expensive). This wasn‚Äôt a cost agreed and now there is back and forth about what I should pay as they spent more on getting home. \n\nI didn‚Äôt choose the earlier flight due to cost, just to get home for my responsibilities as I had work the next day whilst they had an extra day off. Now I feel villainised for doing so, although they were okay with it at the time of me booking my flight. I feel like I‚Äôve been more than fair in splitting the flights but the train was a surprise cost put on me. Before the holiday I hosted them the night before and my partner gave us a lift to the airport which saved us about ¬£50-¬£60 in airport transfers and he also paid for the drop off cost. \n\nAm I the asshole for disagreeing with this? I struggle to set boundaries sometimes and feel a bit bullied into this. I feel like they have fallen out with me over this, which seems pointless as we have had a lovely holiday. Has anyone got any advice with this? I want to say no but I am struggling with advocating for myself here. ",

She calls me Olly's 'cute little baby brother', pinches my cheeks, and gives me sucky lollipops, like the ones you get from Sainsbury's, and always asks me to eat them in front of her, even though they're kinda gross. \n\nI'm 19 fucking years old and she's acting like some old auntie with a child. I feel bad, because she's a really nice person and she does probably see me as a little brother of some kind since she's always getting me stuff and giving me compliments, telling me how much I look like Olly. \n\nThis all came to a head earlier today, when Molly gave me one of those suckers, and I said thank you and put it in my pocket. She told me she wanted to see me have it, as I was a 'growing boy' and she was worried about me. This is where I may have been TA, because I snapped at her that I wasn't a 'growing boy', I was grown fucking adult and I'd appreciate it if she stopped treating me like a kid.\n\nShe got really upset, and told me she didn't expect me to be so rude and impolite.  She went back over to Olly, and I went back to my room and I'm feeling really guilty now. I didn't mean to upset her, but I just don't want to be treated like a bloody toddler anymore.",

            "selftext": "I got married (22f) to my husband (24m) a few weeks ago. The wedding overall went great even though there were a few minor hiccups. We hired a professional photographer who stated in his contract that we couldn't hire another photographer besides him. If we wanted a second photographer, we had to hire one of his assistants or coworkers. This is pretty typical in the wedding industry.\n\nMy aunt surprised us at the wedding by doing photography as a gift to us. This was very surprising and she didn't tell anyone besides her husband. She's a real estate photographer, so she has a fancy camera and occasionally takes pictures of people. Our photographer was PISSED. He pulled me aside and asked what was going on and I had to explain the whole situation, which made me extremely stressed. While taking pictures, my aunt would pull people aside when they needed to be with the professional photographer for group photos. It turned into a chaotic mess, but we wanted to be kind and were SO stressed and had no time to tell her to stop.\n\nWe got the photos back from her last night. The photos of me were rough. They're taken from a low angle so I have a double chin, my mouth is open in 1/3 of the shots (talking, eating, etc). There's zoom ins of my face and my eyes are closed. They're pretty much all candid's. You can see how stressed out I am in my facial expressions, because behind the scenes the real photographer was shouting at us to hurry up.\n\nIn comparison, the photos of my friends taken by her were all staged by her and look gorgeous. People are smiling , posed, and beautiful. I began sobbing seeing them. I showed the photos to a few of my friends and they very kindly told me that they were unflattering pictures of me.\n\nMy family received the photos and plans on putting them up in their house because they're from my aunt. I asked them to wait because we will have professional photos soon, but they don't want to wait for those. I'm insecure about my appearance and I've been sent photos of me squinting or with my eyes closed with a double chin calling me beautiful and I just know that's not the case based on my non family member's reactions.\n\nMy husband said these features are normal in humans and that he didn't like his hair in the pictures and to just get used to it. I cried off and on when looking at them and told him it was different because he's smiling, his eyes are open in the photos. He got angry and said the point of a wedding is to celebrate our love and that the photos don't matter. He told me to just stop looking at them if it's going to make me cry and I just didn't say anything after that.  I wish he was more empathetic, but he thinks I'm being self centered and remained upset at me for crying for the rest of the night.\n\n  \nEdit: We had already started taking professional photos when she showed up and began grabbing people for pictures. We didn't fully realize what was going on until she began grabbing people away. We thought she was just taking photos of her own kids. After she began taking pictures of everyone and grabbing people, she told us it was our gift and the photographer asked what was up and we told him and he saw how upset we were so he didn't' leave. We had 30 minutes until the ceremony and we didn't want to start an argument with her when we were stressed enough.\n\n\n\nAITA",

            "selftext": "I (30 F) have a sister (29) that has been a spoiled child since she was born. Not only my parents, but everybody would overprotect and give her anything she demanded,  claiming that she was the sweetest. On the other hand, i've always been rebellious and independent. This resulted in me working since i was 16, and currently owning my own successful business, while she has not worked a day in her life until a few months ago.\n\nSince i make a pretty good amount of money, i shower them both, my mom and my sister, with gifts everytime i can. Cellphones, brand clothing... anything, and it is never the other way around.\n\nI decided not to help my mom with anymore money until my sister  began to do the same, because she's been avoiding that responsibility saying she is depressed or anxious.  \n\nShe recently got a job as a personal assistant, where she required  to know some stuff to get the job done. She also needed a computer and she needed some specific apps. \n\nI pay a monthly fee for those apps, so i shared my password with her, taought her how to use them, and lend her some money to get a laptop. I've been helping with anything she needs.\n\nBut today, she decided to go back to her old self. Demanding help and miss treating me afterwards. I decided to give back the same attitude and we ended up having a big fight. I decided to change my passwords, not allowing her to work anymore on what she was doing. I know she can't afford them, and now i have her, my mother and a couple of relatives calling me the ah. They are demanding me to apologize and give the new passwords.\n\nI'm so done with her being a 29yo spoiled kid. If itah, then so be it.\n",

            "selftext": "Me and my friends usually do get togethers at my friends house since she is the one with the nicest patio/backyard. Two weeks ago we arranged our usual get together and planned on playing board games (nothing too crazy), she told us to come at 7 but since I do not drive and depend on my mom to take me everywhere I was a little late (15min aprox) and forgot to let her know, when I got there I sent her a message letting her know I was there to which she replied \"give me 10 min\", nothing weird since she has done that before when she's not ready yet. After 15 min aprox I texted her again asking if she could open the door since it was getting windy to which she replies \"No, you made me wait 15 minutes so now I'll make you wait 20\" I was PERPLEXED, she had never ever done anything like this before and mind you in our culture it's pretty common to arrive a little bit later that the accorded hour (15-20min), by the time she opened the door my other friend was already there waiting for her and she did not make her wait outside like she did with me, I said jokingly since that is how we talk to each other \"How unpunctual\" to which she replied \"Tone it down, Im not in the mood\" this was the final straw for me so I told her I was leaving, took an uber home and have not talked to her since, so am I the asshole for leaving and getting mad?\n\nUPDATE \nThank you everyone! Me and my friend talked in person about this whole situation, while she seemed mad about my behaviour she also accepted that she was in the wrong and definitely not in the mood that evening, I also apologized for being late and promised to do better since I know it can be frustrating for others. Hopefully this never happens again! ",

            "selftext": "I (18f) live with my dad(50m), mom(49f), and brother(10m). for context I spent hours making a cake for my Boyfriend(18m) as a present. It was the best cake I have ever made and i was extremely proud of it. when I made it i told my family to not eat it, and to ask me if they wanted some. i mentioned it multiple times and they all agreed and promised they wouldn‚Äôt. this was a very important cake to me and since it was technically my boyfriends i didn‚Äôt want them eating it without permission. \n\nwhen i gave my boyfriend the cake he loved it and it was a really nice moment. fast forward to today( a day later ) i was still telling them to not eat it. i had decided to go to my boyfriends house and hang out there today, i trusted my family to leave the cake alone as they new how much it meant to me and they told me they would leave it alone. me and my boyfriend had a good day but when i had gotten home i realized a whole chunk of the cake was gone. i got upset because the part they had eaten was the part with his name( that was the part i specifically saved for him ) \n\ni went to my brother and dad and i asked them if they had eaten it and my brother told me that he had LICKED the frosting of of part of it. so basically the cake part was just thrown away or someone else ate it. i got upset and said that he should have asked me, but my dad got defensive and said that it was my fault for keeping it here and if it was my boyfriends i should have taken it to his house. i said that i was just mad because i had told them specifically to ask me and they still didn‚Äôt listen. he started yelling at me and calling me rude and selfish and saying i was being over dramatic. i told him i wasn‚Äôt and that i was allowed to be upset, but then my mom yelled at me and was asking what was going on and when i told her she said it was stupid and i was being over dramatic and said i was choosing my boyfriend over my family.\n\ni feel like they should have understood why i was upset and not have eaten it without asking in the first place but i don‚Äôt know AITA?\n\nEdit: this is not a fake story and like i stated previously i had told them to at least ask me beforehand. i was not telling them that they cant have any i was telling them to ask me first because it was not their cake.",
